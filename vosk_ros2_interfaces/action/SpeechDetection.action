# Goal

bool continuous         # If true, keep listening continuously until canceled
bool enable_speaker_id  # If true, include speaker recognition if available
bool publish_partial    # If true, send partial results as feedback

# Result

RecognizedSpeech final_result  # The final recognized speech, will be empty in continuous mode
bool success                   # True if recognition succeeded
string error_message           # Reason if recognition failed

---
# Feedback

RecognizedSpeech continous_result  # Like final_result, just for continuous mode
string partial_text                # Simple partial text during recognition
